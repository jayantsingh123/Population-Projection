# Population-Projection
In this project, we explore the population dataset, obtained from the link; https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2012/demo/popproj/2012-popproj.html. We explore the population projections from July 1,2012 through July 1,2060.

## Organization of the Project

The sections of the project are organized in the following manner:
* figure-html contains the figures used in the project, built using ggplot in R
* projection.md is the markdown file containing all the description and accompanying figures.
* Data variables definitions contains description regarding the variables in the dataset.
* Copy.rar is the dataset used for this analysis.
